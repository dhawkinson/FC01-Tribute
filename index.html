                    <p>I have tried, in this tribute, to paint a picture of neither a saint nor a demon. I have cherry-picked through the events of Bob Dylan's life with regard for only one goal, to paint a picture of a man with serious convictions regarding social justice, what is good and what is right, who had the courage to stand by his convictions, whatever the consequences. They are maybe not the events that he would see as the most significant. I don't know. I have never met the man. But I have listened to his music (most of it) for more than 50 years, and seen him in live concert once. I find myself quoting his lyrics, as have Supreme Court Justices, because they are relevant to life. So, I have picked the events that indicate milestones to me.</p>
                    <p>In 54 years he has released 37 albums, some to acclaim, some to scorn. Dylan has experimented with a wide variety of genres, from folk to rap. But he has never pandered to either his fan base or commercial manipulation. During his gospel tenure, he suffered tremendous abuse by the critics and his fan base. But he unflinchingly stuck to his guns and played from his convictions. He has walked out on shows, refusing to be censored. He has received accolades from Presidents and Popes. He has been honored by the music industry and academia. He has sung, produced, written (music, books and screenplays), acted, been a benefactor. He is a true Renaissance Man.</p>
                    <p>These cherry-pickings have been taken from the Wikipedia article on Bob Dylan. They represent a fraction of the material that is there. I recommend you see the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan">full article</a>.</p>
